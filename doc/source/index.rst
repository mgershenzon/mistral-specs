Approved specifications
=======================

These specifications have been approved but have not been completely
implemented. Approved specifications are grouped in the development cycles. If
a specification has been approved but not completed within one or more
releases since the approval, it may be re-reviewed to make sure it still makes
sense as written. So, a specification may be seen in different groups:

Mitaka
------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   specs/mitaka/approved/*

Newton
------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   specs/newton/approved/*


Implemented specifications
==========================

These specifications have been implemented and are grouped by the development
cycles in which they were completed.

Mitaka
------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   specs/mitaka/implemented/*

Newton
------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   specs/newton/implemented/*
